# TK Photography

## Objective

I was tasked with developing a photo gallery webpage using the content and mockup provided by the client.  This project was an opportunity to apply the skills and knowledge I had gained during my Internet and Web Development program while delivering a professional, client-ready solution.

## Synopsis

The project was designed to help the client showcase their photo gallery to visitors of the website.  In addition to displaying the client’s images, the website also provides visitors with the opportunity to contact the client directly, creating a functional and engaging user experience.

## Process

I used Visual Studio Code as the primary tool for coding the HTML and CSS, ensuring that the final website matched the client’s expectations.  The client provided images, colors, and fonts, which allowed me to replicate their desired aesthetic.  My approach focused on translating the provided mockup with a functional, visually appealing webpage while maintaining attention to detail.

## Results

The website was completed on time with zero budget, achieving an exact match to the client’s vision.  The final product allows visitors to explore the photo gallery seamlessly while providing an easy way to contact the client.  The website can be viewed in full at the following link:
